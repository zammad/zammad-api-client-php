# Zammad API Client for PHP

This client can be used to access the API of the open source helpdesk [Zammad](http://www.zammad.org) via PHP.

## Zammad version support
This client supports Zammad 3.4.1 and newer.

## Installation

### Requirements
The API client needs [composer](https://getcomposer.org/). For installation have a look at its [documentation](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
Additionally, the API client needs PHP 7.2 or newer.

### Integration into your project
Add the following to the "require" section of your project's composer.json file:
```json
"zammad/zammad-api-client-php": "^2.0"
```

### Installing the API client's dependencies
Fetch the API client's code and its dependencies by updating your project's dependencies with composer:
```
$ composer update
```

Once installed, you have to include the generated autoload.php into your project's code:
```php
require_once dirname(__DIR__).'/vendor/autoload.php';
```

## How to use the API client

### Example code
You can find example code within the directory `examples`.

### The Client object
Your starting point is the `Client` object:
```php
use ZammadAPIClient\Client;
$client = new Client([
    'url'           => 'https://myzammad.com', // URL to your Zammad installation
    'username'      => 'myuser@myzammad.com',  // Username to use for authentication
    'password'      => 'mypassword',           // Password to use for authentication
    // 'timeout'       => 15,                  // Sets timeout for requests, defaults to 5 seconds, 0: no timeout
    // 'debug'         => true,                // Enables debug output
    // 'verify'        => true,                // Enabled SSL verification. You can also give a path to a CA bundle file. Default is true.
]);
```
Besides using a combination of `username` and `password`, you can alternatively give an `http_token` or an `oauth2_token`.
**Important:** You have to activate API access in Zammad.

### Fetching a single Resource object
To fetch a `Resource` object by ID, e. g. a ticket with ID 34, use the `Client` object:
```php
use ZammadAPIClient\ResourceType;
$ticket = $client->resource( ResourceType::TICKET )->get(34);
```

`$ticket` now is a `Resource` object which holds the data of the ticket and provides all of the methods for setting/getting specific values (like the title of the ticket) and sending changed values to Zammad to update the ticket.

Note: Once you successfully called `get` on a `Resource` object, you cannot call it again, instead you have to create a new one with `resource`.

### Accessing values of Resource objects
You can access the values of a `Resource` object via its 'value' methods.
```php
$ticket->setValue( 'title', 'My ticket title' );
$title = $ticket->getValue('title');
$all_values = $ticket->getValues();
```

Please note that the API client does not provide checks for nor does it know about the available fields of the `Resource` objects. If you set or get a value of a non-existing field or set an invalid value, Zammad will ignore it or return an error.

So, how can you know which fields are available? Just fetch an existing `Resource` object and have a look at the returned fields. A fresh Zammad system always contains an object with ID 1 for every resource type.

Additionally you can have a look at the REST interface documentation of Zammad:

[Introduction to the REST interface](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/api/intro.html)
* [Users](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/api/user.html)
* [Groups](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/api/group.html)
* [Organizations](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/api/organization.html)
* [Tickets](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/api/ticket.html)
   * [Ticket articles](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/api/ticket-article.html)
   * [Ticket priorities](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/api/ticket-priority.html)
   * [Ticket states](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/api/ticket-state.html)
* [Tags](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/api/tags.html)
* [Tag list](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/api/ticket/tags.html#administration-scope)

#### Fetching a ticket's articles
If you already have a ticket object, you can easily fetch its articles:
```php
$ticket_articles = $ticket->getTicketArticles();
```

#### Fetching content of ticket article attachments
The content of ticket article attachments can be fetched with a call of `getAttachmentContent()` of the ticket article resource object:
```php
$attachment_content = $ticket_article->getAttachmentContent(23);
```

In the above example 23 is the ID of the attachment. This ID can be found within the `attachments` array of the ticket article data. Usually you want to loop over this array to fetch the content of all attachments.

### Updating Resource objects
If you fetched a `Resource` object and changed some values, you have to send your changes to Zammad. You do this with a simple call:
```php
$ticket->save();
```

`save()` will check it itself but if you somehow need to know if a `Resource` object has unsaved changes, you can check it with:
```php
if ( $ticket->isDirty() ) {...}
```

Note: Some resource types don't support updating the values of certain fields. Please refer to the API documentation (see links above).

### Creating Resource objects
To create a new `Resource` object, use the following code (example):
```php
use ZammadAPIClient\ResourceType;

$ticket = $client->resource( ResourceType::TICKET );
$ticket->setValue( 'title', 'My new ticket' );
// ...
// Set additional values
// ...
$ticket->save(); // Will create a new ticket object in Zammad
```

### Searching Resource objects
Some types of resources can be searched, pagination is available.
```php
use ZammadAPIClient\ResourceType;

// Fulltext search
$tickets = $client->resource( ResourceType::TICKET )->search('some text');

// Field specific search
$tickets = $client->resource( ResourceType::TICKET )->search('title:My Title');

// Field specific search with more than one field
$tickets = $client->resource( ResourceType::TICKET )->search('title:My Title AND priority_id:1');

// Pagination: Page 1, 25 entries per page
$tickets = $client->resource( ResourceType::TICKET )->search( 'some text', 1, 25 );
```

Note that there is a configurable server-side limit for the number of returned objects (e. g. 500). This limit also applies to the number of entries per page. If you call search() with 1000 entries per page and the server-side limit is set to 500, the server-side limit will be applied.

A successful search (which might have zero results) returns an array of objects (or an empty array). If the result is the original caller object, there was an error (see error handling below).
Therefore, the code for searching should look like the following:

```php
use ZammadAPIClient\ResourceType;

$tickets = $client->resource( ResourceType::TICKET )->search('some text');
if ( !is_array($tickets) ) {
    // Error handling
    print $tickets->getError();
}
else {
    // Do something with $tickets array
}
```

Note: You cannot use a `Resource` object that contains data (either via `get`, `search`, `all` or by setting values on a new object) to execute a search. Use a new `Resource` object instead.


### Fetching 'all' Resource objects
For some types of resources, all available objects can be fetched, pagination is available.

```php
use ZammadAPIClient\ResourceType;

// Fetch all tickets (keep in mind the server-side limit, see 'Searching Resource objects')
$tickets = $client->resource( ResourceType::TICKET )->all();

// Fetch all tickets with pagination (keep in mind the server-side limit, see 'Searching Resource objects'), page 4, 50 entries per page
$tickets = $client->resource( ResourceType::TICKET )->all( 4, 50 );
```
A successful call of `all` (which might have zero results) returns an array of objects (or an empty array). If the result is the original caller object, there was an error (see error handling below).
Therefore, the code to use `all` should look like the following:

```php
use ZammadAPIClient\ResourceType;

$tickets = $client->resource( ResourceType::TICKET )->all( 4, 50 ); // pagination
if ( !is_array($tickets) ) {
    // Error handling
    print $tickets->getError();
}
else {
    // Do something with $tickets array
}
```

Note: You cannot use a `Resource` object that contains data (either via `get`, `search`, `all` or by setting values on a new object) to execute `all`. Use a new `Resource` object instead.

### Deleting a Resource object
To be able to delete a `Resource` object that exists in Zammad, you must first fetch it from Zammad, either via `get`, `all` or `search`.
You can also delete a newly created `Resource` object that has not been sent to Zammad yet. But this should only rarely be necessary because you can simply create a new `Resource` object via the `Client` object.
To delete a `Resource` object, simply call `delete` on it:
```php
$ticket->delete();
```

This clears the object from all data and if possible deletes it in Zammad. The PHP object itself remains. You can reuse it for another `Resource` object or simply drop it.

### Working with tags

#### Adding a tag to an object

Zammad can assign tags to an object. Currently this is only supported for ticket objects.

```php
use ZammadAPIClient\ResourceType;

// The third parameter 'Ticket' is the object type for which the ID will be given as first parameter.
$client->resource( ResourceType::TAG )->add( $ticket_id, 'tag 1', 'Ticket' );
```


#### Remove a tag from an object

```php
use ZammadAPIClient\ResourceType;

$client->resource( ResourceType::TAG )->remove( $ticket_id, 'tag 1', 'Ticket' );
```

#### Getting all tags assigned to an object

```php
use ZammadAPIClient\ResourceType;

// The second parameter 'Ticket' is the object type for which the ID will be given as first parameter.
$tag = $client->resource( ResourceType::TAG )->get( $ticket_id, 'Ticket' );

// [ 'tag 1', 'tag 2' ]
$tags = $tag->getValue('tags')
```

#### Search for Tags

```php
use ZammadAPIClient\ResourceType;

$tags = $client->resource( ResourceType::TAG )->search('my tag');
```
### Object import

Besides the usual methods available for objects, there is also a method available to import these via CSV. Example for text module CSV import:

```php
use ZammadAPIClient\ResourceType;

$text_modules_csv_string = file_get_contents('text_modules.csv');

$client->resource( ResourceType::TEXT_MODULE )->import($text_modules_csv_string);

```

See __Available resource types and their access methods__ below for resource types that support CSV import.

### Handling Zammad errors
When you access Zammad, you **always** will get a `Resource` object (or an array of such objects) in return, regardless if Zammad returned data or executed your request. In case of errors (e. g. that above ticket with ID 34 does not exist in Zammad), you will get a `Resource` object with a set error which can be checked with the following code:
```php
if ( $ticket->hasError() ) {
    print $ticket->getError();
}
```

If you additionally need more detailed information about connection/request errors, you can access the `Response` object of the `Client` object. It holds the response of the last request that was made.
```php
$last_response = $client->getLastResponse();
```
With this object, you can e. g. get the HTTP status code and the body of the last response.

### Executing an API call on behalf of another user
If you want Zammad to execute an API call on behalf of another user than the one you used for authentication, use the following code before executing the API call(s):
```php
$client->setOnBehalfOfUser('myuser');
```
Any API call after above code will use this setting. If you want to return to using the user you used for authentication, call:
```php
$client->unsetOnBehalfOfUser();
```

Using this setting will be ignored by Zammad before version 2.4.

## Available resource types and their access methods

To be able to use the 'short form' for the resource type, add a
```php
use ZammadAPIClient\ResourceType;
```

to your code. You then can reference the resource type like
```php
$client->resource( ResourceType::TICKET );
```

|Resource type|get|all|search|save|delete|add|remove|import|
